"""MCP Connectors - SPA API (MCP_CONNECTORS_PLAN.md P3; OAuth tier v1 per
OAUTH_CONNECTORS_DESIGN.md).

The SPA's Connectors settings pane talks to the endpoints below. Every
call runs as the logged-in user (``@require_jarvis_user``, no impersonation
here — that already happened, if at all, one layer up in the chat dispatcher)
so ``Jarvis Connector`` row permissions
(``jarvis.chat.connector_permissions``) and the controller's Shared-scope
create/widen gate (``jarvis.jarvis.doctype.jarvis_connector.jarvis_connector
._guard_shared_scope``) apply exactly as they do from the Desk. This module
never bypasses them for a user-authored write; it only reaches for
``ignore_permissions``/``frappe.db.set_value`` for SERVER-DERIVED state (a
fresh ``tools/list`` result and the annotations-driven defaults computed from
it) after the caller-level gate has already run — see ``test_connector`` and
``_replace_allowed_actions`` below.

Real MCP work (the outbound call, SSRF guard, circuit breaker) lives entirely
in ``jarvis.connectors.broker`` (a parallel P1 change, not this file) — this
module resolves a row, checks a permission, and reads/writes plain Frappe
fields around that one call.

Endpoints:
  * ``list_connectors``       - the pane's two-section list (Shared + Mine),
    plus ``catalog``: the in-app provider list the SPA builds its preset picker
    from (``jarvis.connectors.catalog.to_public``, public fields only).
  * ``add_connector``         — create; presets are pinned to their vendor
    endpoint server-side (see ``_PRESET_BASE_URLS``) so "Custom URL" is the
    ONLY way a caller's own ``base_url`` ever reaches a saved row.
  * ``test_connector``        — the "Test connection" button: runs a real
    ``initialize`` + ``tools/list`` through the broker, and on success writes
    ``tools_cache`` and MERGES the ``allowed_actions`` table (existing
    choices survive; a newly-seen action defaults to allowed only if the
    server marked it read-only and non-destructive; a vanished action drops).
  * ``set_allowed_actions``   — the picker's Save: takes ONLY the ``allowed``
    bit from the client per action; ``read_only``/``destructive`` are always
    recomputed from ``tools_cache``, never trusted from the request.
  * ``update_connector``      — edit label/base_url(Custom URL only)/
    credential/enabled; changing the endpoint or the credential invalidates
    the last test (and, for a new endpoint, the whole tools/allowed-actions
    table — a stale cache from a different server would just make the broker
    deny everything as ``action_unknown``, which is confusing, not safer).
  * ``delete_connector``.
  * ``connect_oauth``         - OAuth tier: returns the provider's authorize
    URL for an OAuth-auth-method row. Every OAuth row returns through
    ``mcp_oauth_callback`` below.
  * ``disconnect_oauth``      - deletes the CURRENT user's stored sign-in for an
    OAuth row (per-user, idempotent).
  * ``probe_connector_auth``  - Custom URL sign-in discovery, WITHOUT creating
    anything: "does this address need a sign-in, and where?".
  * ``set_oauth_client_credentials`` - admin-only, static-mode only: the
    client_id/secret an administrator registered at the provider by hand.
  * ``mcp_oauth_callback``    - the ONE redirect URI the discovery engine
    registers and returns to. Login-required (never allow_guest).

ONE SIGN-IN ENGINE (MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_DESIGN.md), and the CATALOG decides whether
a preset may use it. ``jarvis.connectors.catalog`` gives every preset an ``auth``
class, and that class is the whole routing rule for ``auth_method="OAuth"``:

  * ``dcr`` / ``static`` - the spec-compliant discovery engine in
    ``jarvis.connectors.mcp_oauth`` (+ ``mcp_oauth_store``), the SAME code path a
    ``Custom URL`` row takes, except that the address discovery runs against is
    the catalog's pinned one rather than the caller's. A ``static`` preset that
    pins its own endpoints in the catalog (GitHub) is a bring-your-own-app
    provider: its client is SEEDED from those endpoints with no discovery, and an
    administrator (or a Personal row's owner) pastes the client id/secret they
    registered at the vendor. A ``static`` preset that publishes discovery
    metadata (Slack, Box, ...) still runs discovery.
  * ``token`` / ``open`` - no sign-in exists, so asking for OAuth is refused
    (here AND in the connector controller, so a raw DocType write cannot take
    the shortcut the API refuses).

Every OAuth row carries a ``mcp_oauth_client`` link, never anything else, and the
connector controller guarantees a key-only row carries no link.

Custom URL connectors are always available (the ``allow_custom_urls`` policy
was retired on 2026-09-23): a Custom URL row is MCP-only, SSRF-checked and
unusable until its connection test passes, and its write actions park behind
the same confirmation card as a preset's, so it needs no extra gate.

	``ignore_permissions``, so both the plain create-role check and the
	controller's ``_guard_shared_scope`` (only the admin tier may create a
	Shared row) apply exactly as they do from the Desk — a plain user asking
	for ``scope="Shared"`` fails cleanly with the controller's own
	``frappe.PermissionError``, not a custom message here.

	``label`` is OPTIONAL: the SPA no longer asks for a name, so when it is
	omitted the display label is derived here — the preset's own name for a
	built-in preset, or the base URL's hostname for a Custom URL. ``key`` (the
	uniqueness slug the agent passes) is likewise derived: the preset's fixed
	key, or a slug of the Custom URL host. Uniqueness is then enforced on that
	key by the controller (one per app for Shared, one per app per user for
	Personal), so a user cannot connect the same app twice.

	``auth_method`` picks the connection method: "OAuth" IGNORES the
	``credential`` argument entirely (nothing is ever stored in the Password field
	for an OAuth row) and sets the backing link up SERVER-SIDE - a caller can ask
	for OAuth but can never name or steer what backs it. "API Key" is the shipped,
	unchanged behaviour, and an ``open`` preset needs no credential at all (the
	broker sends no Authorization header when the credential is empty).

	``enabled`` defaults to 1 (the shipped behaviour). The dialog passes ``enabled=0``
	when it creates the row on the "Sign in" press, so a half-made Shared row is not
	visible to other users until Save turns it on; the value is coerced with ``cint``
	and clamped to 0/1. ``update_connector`` is what later flips it back on.

	only for a Custom URL. Nothing here re-reads a caller-supplied URL, so a
	preset row can never be discovered - or later signed in - against an address
	its caller named.

	TIME. This is the slowest thing the connectors API does, and every second of it
	is a held worker. The ceiling is deliberate and arithmetic, and WALL-CLOCK
	(``ssrf.open_pinned_request`` clamps DNS, connect and header wait to one
	deadline per hop; ``mcp_oauth.transport._read_capped`` reads the body one
	syscall at a time under the same deadline): ``mcp_oauth.discovery.RUN_TOTAL_TIMEOUT_S`` (45s) for the
	whole discovery run, up to seven hops inside it, plus
	``transport.TOKEN_TOTAL_TIMEOUT_S`` (10s) for the registration POST - 55s worst
	case, with at most ``transport.MAX_REDIRECTS`` (2) redirects per hop, well under
	gunicorn's 120s. The rate limit above is what stops a caller from queueing
	several of those at once.

	ORDER MATTERS. This runs AFTER the insert so every cheap gate has already run
	- the Shared-scope permission check, key uniqueness.
	Those are the likely failures and none of them should cost an outbound
	request first; in particular, registering before the permission check would
	let any Jarvis User drive registration POSTs at an arbitrary host by asking
	for a Shared row they cannot create. If discovery then fails, the row just
	created is removed rather than left behind as an unusable connector.

	The link is written with ``frappe.db.set_value`` because the client cannot
	exist before the connector it points at: this is the second half of ONE
	create, not a user-initiated edit, and must not re-run the row's validation.

	BRING-YOUR-OWN-APP STATIC: a static preset whose sign-in service publishes no
	discovery document declares its endpoints in the catalog (GitHub). For it,
	discover() cannot run and MUST be skipped - the client is seeded straight from
	the pinned, reviewed catalog values, making NO outbound request at all. Every
	other row (a self-registering ``dcr`` preset, a static preset that publishes
	metadata, or a Custom URL) keeps the discover() path unchanged.

	ALL-OR-NOTHING: either half - the catalog seed or discovery/registration - is
	wrapped, so a failure AFTER the row was inserted removes the row rather than
	leaving a half-created, unusable connector behind. ANY failure counts, not just
	the engine's own ``OAuthError``: a client insert that fails (a DB fault, a value

	the GENERIC reason (never anything from the response, so a mix-up response is still
	never shown, RFC 9207) so the poll resolves instead of hanging on "window closed".
	The expired (no record) and stolen-state (wrong user) paths park nothing at all.
