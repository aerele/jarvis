"""In-app connector provider catalog (frappe-free): the single source of truth
for MCP connector presets, their names, pinned endpoints, auth flow, logo and
credential-entry help copy.

Design:

  * This is a baseline catalog. It ships INSIDE the app, in code, reviewed
    like any other change. It is public data (no secrets ever live here) but
    it is also an ALLOWLIST: it decides which endpoint a saved connector's
    credential is ever allowed to be sent to. That is why it belongs behind
    code review rather than a database row an admin edits unsupervised.
  * A `base_url` is a fixed vendor endpoint, `auth` picks one of the four
    connection flows the discovery engine supports, and `logo` / `help_url` /
    `hint` are display copy. None of that is secret. What IS secret, a static
    preset's registered client id/secret, or a user's own bearer token, never
    lives in this module or its overlay; those are stored per tenant on the
    connector's own sign-in client or the connector row's own credential field.
  * `apply_overlay` is the seam for a later admin-pushed extension of this
    list. An overlay may only disable a shipped entry or add a brand-new one;
    it can never change what an existing name already means (its key,
    base_url, auth or category), because an admin push that silently
    redirected an existing preset's traffic would defeat the allowlist.
    Implemented and tested here; nothing calls it yet.

Catalog order: the four presets already shipping (GitHub, Atlassian, Linear,
Stripe) come first in their existing order, so an already-familiar dropdown
does not reshuffle under an existing user. The remaining entries are grouped
by category in the order payments, accounting, crm, commerce, work,
communication, files, design, support, data, web, automation, docs, dev,
matching how they were picked for ERPNext relevance. The SPA's category chips
(``ConnectorDirectory.vue``) follow the same order.

A provider whose sign-in service needs extra, fixed query parameters on the
authorize request (Google: ``access_type=offline`` + ``prompt=consent``, or no
refresh token is ever issued and the connector dies after an hour) declares
them as ``authorize_params``. They are reviewed constants like the pinned
endpoints, never client input, and never a reserved OAuth parameter.

class Provider:
	"""One connector preset. `name` is the display name and IS the `preset`
	value a saved `Jarvis Connector` row stores; `key` is the short slug the
	agent addresses it by.

	The `issuer` / `authorization_endpoint` / `token_endpoint` / `scopes` fields are
	the metadata-less-static seam: a provider whose sign-in service publishes no
	discovery document declares its endpoints (and a default `scopes`) here, so
	`_setup_mcp_oauth_client` can seed the client from the catalog instead of
	running discovery. They are OPTIONAL and only ever set on a `static` provider
	(`validate` enforces that, all three endpoints together or none), so every
	self-registering (`dcr`) preset and every `static` preset that DOES publish
	metadata (Slack, Box, ...) leaves them None and keeps the discovery path
	unchanged.

	`token_hint` / `token_help_url` are the paste-a-token guidance shown when a user
	picks "use a token instead" of a sign-in. They are display copy allowed on ANY
	auth class (`validate` only requires `token_help_url` be https), kept separate
	from `hint` / `help_url` because on a `static` (bring-your-own-app) preset those
	now carry the register-your-own-app guide, not token guidance. A `dcr` preset
	(Atlassian, Linear) self-registers its app, so its `hint` / `help_url` are
	unaffected and still carry token guidance.

	`description` is one short plain line naming what the app is for (its data, not
	a protocol), shown under the name in the SPA's preset picker. `validate` requires
	it non-empty, and `to_public` ships it. It has a `""` default only so `replace`
	and an overlay's new-entry branch have a value to fall back to; a shipped entry
	that left it blank would fail `validate` at import.

	`authorize_params` is a tuple of ``(name, value)`` pairs appended verbatim to
	the authorize request (Google needs ``access_type=offline`` and
	``prompt=consent`` to issue a refresh token at all). `validate` only allows it
	on a sign-in class (`static` / `dcr`) and rejects any reserved OAuth parameter
	name, so a catalog entry can add to the request but never override the PKCE,
	resource or redirect binding the flow sets. It is server-side only: never
	shipped by `to_public`."""
